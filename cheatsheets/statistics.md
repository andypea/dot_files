## Definitions

Sample Space

: A set $\Omega$.

Set of Events

: The set of measurable sets in $\Omega$. A $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F} \subset 2^\Omega$

Probability Measure

: A $\sigma$-additive function $P: \mathcal{F} \mapsto [ 0, 1 ]$ which satisfies $P ( \Omega ) = 1$

Probability Space

: A measure space $( \Omega, \mathcal{F}, P )$ which satisfies the condition that $\mathcal{F} ( \Omega ) = 1$

Random Variable

: A measurable function from a probability space to a measurable space. $X : ( \Omega, \mathcal{F}, P ) \mapsto ( E, \epsilon )$

Expected Value

: $E[X] = \int_\Omega X( \omega ) d P( \omega )$ 

Estimate

: An (informed) guess about the value of some quantity.

# TODO

  - Tidy up the definition of a probability space and its relationship to a measure space.
