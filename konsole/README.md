# Installation

To install system-wide, copy the desired files (not the folder) into the appropriate folder.  You can download and install only one file if you know what theme you want to use.

KDE Version | Available To |Location
------------|--------------|-----------------------
KDE 5       | System Wide  | `/usr/share/konsole`
KDE 5       | User Only    | `~/.local/share/konsole`
KDE 4       | System Wide  | `/usr/share/kde4/apps/konsole`
KDE 4       | User Only    | `~/.kde4/apps/konsole/`

NOTE: For `*.schema` files designed to work with the version of konsole included with KDE3, see [base16-konsole-kde3][kde3].

You must restart konsole, then you can select the theme you would like to use through the menus.
