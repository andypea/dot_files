# base16-xfce4-terminal

This is a
[``template``](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-templates-source) for
[base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) which supports xfce4-terminal

## Installation

Put the prebuilt ``*.theme`` files from ``colorschemes/`` into
``~/.local/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes/`` (create this directory if it
does not exist), and the themes will be available under ``Edit > Preferences...
> Colors > Presets``

## Manual building

If you want to build the themes under ``colorschemes/`` yourself,
a ``builder`` like [this](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder-php) is
required,
or use ``build.go``.
